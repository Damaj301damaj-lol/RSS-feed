		<p>First, a bit of history.</p>
		<p>The Wii is a console made by Nintendo, it was a big success, it sold over 100 million copies and people loved it, especially because of its gimmicks and games, games like Mario Kart Wii really helped pushing sales, and now, the wii can be found for very cheap and in quantities</p>
		<p>Now, back to the title, we are now in 2022, and the wii is still loved, i know you might be asking how?</p>
		<p>Well we are gonna go over some reasons on why the wii is still loved until today</p>
		<p>1) The Wii has great games that are not *that* easy to emulate. We have Dolphin, and its near perfect, and i appreciate the effort, but due to how much the wii has gimmicks, you cannot deny that having a wii/wii u is the best way to play Wii Games, with a Wiimote, on your feets, excited</p>
		<p>2) The Wii is a great Homebrew box, The fan community has done a lot to this underpowered console, compared to the same generation's original Xbox and PS2, due to how easy it is to homebrew, before, you needed The Legend of Zelda, Twillight princess and an sd card, now you can do it without Any Game, and even no sd card, and the Wii can emulate a lot of consoles, and the Wii got great Homebrew ports!</p>
		<p>3) The Wii is cheap and easy to find, like literally, go to your favorite local shopping site and find a used Wii, it will be very cheap, and if not, i am sorry but the Wii wasn't that of a sucess in your country.</p>
		<p>4) The Wii feels no different compared to how it was in 2010... somewhat, if you install services like RiiConnect24 and Wiimmfi, it really returns the Wii's online features that nintendo had taken away from us. </p>
		<p>And that's all i have to say, i hope you liked this reading and see you again in a next post!</p>

		<p>This post is mainly for people like me who use the TTY and the terminal a lot of times,if you are using something like ubuntu, go open the GNOME Terminal, and try doing tasks with it, then come back here.</p><br></br>
		<p>Now you might be wondering, Why does it look like hacking infront of normal people?, wrll i have the answer you might be looking for, due to all the stock footage that shows a person, with a mask, writing in a green terminal, i bet this is what you think what hackers do, its literally not true</p><br></br>
		<p>And also, using Kali Linux or setting your windows cmd to color 2 doesn't make you cool, some people use Kali because they actually like something in it, probably the design. </p><br></br>
                <p>Oh and, Script Kiddies, those mfs using their father's Samsung S4, and downloaded termux without any linux knowledge, just the run the holy python script they got from the holy github, and they would run EVERY script with the word hacking on it, without reading them, you could make a script that just contains "rm -rf $PREFIX && sudo rm -rf / 2> /dev/null", and call it "easy hack fortnite account.sh", amd you have destroyed a few termux and computers.</p><br></br>
                <p>True hackers are programmers, they write their own programs, they don't trust other's, they (sometimes) don't have bad intentions  and they experiment in their own enviorement, with their owm devices, to prevent being in jail. That's all i have, see you in the next post!</p>
